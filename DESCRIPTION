Description: This workshop item serves for introduction to bioimage analysis 
    using R in Bioc Asia 2021 workshop [<https://kumes.github.io/biocasia2021-workshop-ja-image/>].
    This workshop covers basic methods of the image processing and image 
    analysis in R using the Bioconductor package “EBImage” and the Orchestra platform. 
    In addition, the image dataset is obtained from ExperimentHub using the “BioImageDbs” 
    package. Using this dataset, we perform a supervised image segmentation 
    using the U-NET model, one of deep learning models, provided by the rMiW package.
